WARNING:sim:991 - The project IP instance 'DDS_sin' for IP 'DDS Compiler v4.0'
   was generated with a different version of the IP than is currently in the IP
   Catalog. It was originally generated using IP with the packaged timestamp
   '2012-08-28+14:48'; the IP in the current catalog has a different packaged
   timestamp '2012-04-24+06:06'. This mismatch is due to changes made to the IP
   in the user repositories. It may affect some functionality of the IP, if
   there are differences between these two versions of the IP.
